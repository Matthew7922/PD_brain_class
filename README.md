# Classify PD brain with structural MRI image
a brainhack 2023 project

**A short description of your idea**
Parkinson's disease as the second most neurodegenerative disease worldwide 
is still lack of good neuroimage biomarker. Although we would performed 
basic structural MRI image with T1 sequence clinically, there's still lack 
of obvious feature to assist the identification of Parkinson's disease. 
My project aims to extract the features from the Parkinson's disease T1 
sequence via principal component analysis and independent component 
analysis. After extraction of the features, the features would further fed 
into supportive vector machine to trained a classification model.

**Goals of your project**
*  Explore the structural features of PD brains
* Established a classification models by machine learning method

**Data and Tools to use**
* Data from Parkinson Progression Marker Initiatives (PPMI)
